# ReUniProj

This repository is basically a journal of my journey through the computer science major in university.
I've listed all the cs courses I've taken in university and a brief explaination about the course.
Many of these courses had a course project and I wanted to try and go back and recreate them from scratch.
Some of them did not have projects but I think it had enough content to create a new project that shows what I've learned from the course.
These remakes are **NOT** the originals I or my team submitted! All the code here are by me.
I may use the original as reference so that I cover the same things but with original code.

Why am I remaking them? Its just for fun and practice / review! 
The main idea / functions for the most part are the same, the remakes may add some polish, extra features, etc. 
Some of them may actually be simpler then the original... 
I'll still include the names of my partners from the original if I had worked on the projects in a group, just seemed right to do so...?

## cs100 | Introduction to the Profession

cs100 was one of the first courses we had to take, it was to show what the industry is like and what the major is like. 
We got to work with real companies in this course to experience first hand what it would be like to work in the industry!
There was no real course project for us but if we chose to work with a company during this course, we had sort of a project to work on.

***College Finance Calculator***

**About:** My group and the company we worked with decided to make a financial calculator to help with planning out debt and financial aid.
We didn't really write any code for it, mainly just google slides for the ui. Just learning about the work flow of working in the tech industry, not really learning any programming.

## cs115 | Object Oriented Programming I

cs115 was the first real programming course we had to take. We learn about basic programming practices and java syntax.

***Dice Game***

About: The course project we had was a dice game where you roll 2 die and try to eliminate all the numbers 1 to 12. The ui was in the java terminal.
2 dies were rolled and you get 2 numbers, you can either sum the numbers and eliminate that number or to eliminate the 2 individual numbers. 
You lose if neither option is availabe or you will after elimiating all 12 numbers.
For the remake, I wanted to make the real game that this project seemed to be based on, *Shut the Box*.

***Intro AI***

About: There are 3 main projects: Tic Tac Toe AI, Sukoku AI, and a path finder.
Tic Tac Toe AI was one of the assigned projects from a previous semester, 
it wasn't one of the projects assigned to me when I took it but I'd like to still try it too.
These are all in python, so some of them can be slow.
