# ReUniProj

This repository is basically a journal of my journey through the computer science major in 
university. I've listed all the cs courses I've taken in university and a brief explaination about 
the course. Many of these courses had a course project and I wanted to try and go back and 
recreate them from scratch. Some of them did not have projects but I think it had enough content 
to create a new project that shows what I've learned from the course. I've also included some 
project from classes that were not categorized as cs courses but were still programming heavy. 
These remakes are **NOT** the originals I or my team submitted! All the code here are by me. I may 
use the original as reference so that I cover the same things but with original code.

Why am I remaking them? Its just for fun and practice / review! The main idea / functions for the 
most part are the same, the remakes may add some polish, extra features, etc. Some of them may 
actually be simpler then the original... I'll still include the names of my partners from the 
original if I had worked on the projects in a group, just seemed right to do so...?

## cs100 | Introduction to the Profession

CS100 was one of the first courses I had to take, it was to show what the industry is like and 
what the major is like. I got to work with real companies in this course to experience first hand 
what it would be like to work in the industry! There was no real course project for us but if we 
chose to work with a company during this course, we had sort of a project to work on.

**Original Project:** 
My group and the company we worked with decided to make a financial calculator to help with 
planning out debt and financial aid. We didn't really write any code for it, mainly just google 
slides for the ui. Just learning about the work flow of working in the tech industry, not really 
learning any programming.

## cs115 | Object Oriented Programming I

CS115 was the first real programming course we had to take. We learn about common programming 
practices, java syntax, how object oriented programming works, and basic things like variable
types and basic loops and such.

**Original Project:** 
The course project we had was a dice game where you roll 2 die and try to eliminate all the 
numbers 1 to 12. The ui was in the java terminal. 2 dies were rolled and you get 2 numbers, you 
can either sum the numbers and eliminate that number or to eliminate the 2 individual numbers. You 
lose if neither option is availabe or you will after elimiating all 12 numbers. For the remake, I 
wanted to make the real game that this project seemed to be based on, *Shut the Box*.

## cs116 | Object Oriented Programming II

This course was the continuation of Object Oriented Programming I. We learned about more advanced 
syntax and concepts such as recursion and exception handling. We also started to work with object 
oriented programming concepts like abstract classes, polymorphism, and inheritance.

**Original Project:** 
The course project was to make our own custom java data frame and a few basic functions to go with 
it. Java doesn't have a built in data frame like how python does so we were tasked to make our own.
For the remake, I want make this data frame and then make a book library application on top of the 
data frame. We also were not able to fully implement all the functions we were asked of when we 
took the course so I feel that I should do so for completion sake.

simple os similar to it?

finder and I would like to make that as well.

university was using. The original site / program my university used for tracking grades and 
assignments was called blackboard so we called ours whiteboard. We didn't actually right any code 
so the project didn't have any functionality. We only made plans and some ui, no real code.

## Other | Other Projects

There were a few other courses I took during my time at the university that was not under the 
computer science department but were still programming heavy and had projects I think are worth 
trying to remake.

**Original Project:** 
In my COM 421 | Technical Communications course, we had to make several basic websites so I think 
I could make a basic website here for a remake. I can try different tricks with css and html.

**Original Contributors:** 
Just me

**Original Project:** 
For my Ipro I | Cyber Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship, my group chose to make a chrome 
extension that would scan for privacy polices and provide a pop up summary. This project touched 
on many different things I've yet to do on my own such as creating a scraper, browser extentions 
and AI api interactions.
